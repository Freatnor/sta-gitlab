# Git and GitHub @STA

## Get started with Git and GitHub
First download the latest version of Git at the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Create a Github account if needed at https://github.com and connect command line Git with Github with the [following steps](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

## Fork this repo
Split into pairs and select one person to do this bit

Fork [this repo](https://github.com/Freatnor/sta-gitlab) using the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

> Can also try and hardmode using the github cli https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_fork

## First partner fills out first two questions
> Can use the default "main" branch or create a new one using "git checkout -b [branch name]"
> may also need to "git pull origin" or "git fetch"
> 
The partner who created the new fork fills out the first two questions of the other file

Push up changes using "git push origin [branch name]"

## Second partner fills out last two questions
> Can once again create a new branch. If new name the branch different from partner 1's
> 
Fill out the final two questions

Push up changes using "git push origin [branch name]"


## Merge both changes
The second partner will go through the merge (partner 1 can help :)

If using one branch simply pull the branch changes using "git pull origin" or "git pull origin [branch name]"

Otherwise pull partner 1's branch locally using "git fetch" or "git pull origin [other branch name]" and follow "git merge [other branch name]"

Push up this final merge to main branch

> If either partner wants to make more changes simply duplicate the steps above

## Create a Pull Request
With the final merged version open a pull request to the original repo [here](https://github.com/Freatnor/sta-gitlab/compare)!
